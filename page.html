            <!-- CONTAIN TEXTUAL INFORMATION REGARDING LADY STANHOPE IN THIS DIV -->
            <p>     Lady Hester Lucy Stanhope was a pioneer of Western travel to remote areas of the Middle East. Born in London, England on March 12, 1776, she was a sharp-witted and charismatic woman who rejected societal conventions and paved her own path in life. She lived a life rife with adventure and political intrigue.</p>
            <p>     The first child of Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl of Stanhope, Lady Stanhope was raised by a wealthy and powerful political family. Her first taste of travel came during a brief period of peace between Britain and France in 1802, when she travelled across Europe. Upon her return to England, she joined her maternal uncle, former Prime Minister William Pitt, to be his social hostess. She was able to gain political insight and exercise power and influence among English high society in this role.</p>
            <p>     In 1810, after the deaths of her half-brother and lover during the Battle of Corunna, she travelled East with her physician, Dr. Charles Meryon, and another Englishman she met during her travels, Michael Bruce. Lady Hester adopted men's clothing in the Ottoman Empire when most of her possessions were lost during a shipwreck and maintained this fashion until her death. She explored many cities and countries before settling down in what is now modern-day Lebanon. Her travels included Malta, Cairo, Athens, Constantinople, Damascus, and Syria.</p>
            <p>     Lady Hester accomplished quite a lot, from being the first Wester woman to see Palmyra to conducting what is now considered to be the first use of modern archaeological principles to excavate a site to eventually being the de facto ruler of Lebanon. Her archaeological expedition in Palestine paved the way for future excavations and tourism to not only the site, but the Middle East at large. </p>
            <p>     If her later years, Lady Hester was unfortunately bested by debt and stress. She lost most of her influence and power, dying penniless in her sleep on June 23, 1839. While unfortunate, this inauspicious end to an extraordinary woman's life shouldn't overshadow the adventures and accomplishments Lady Hester Stanhope was able to complete over the course of her unusual life. </p>
